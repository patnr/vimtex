# For some reason (that I'm working on two different computers?) the `my_mods` branch
# often seems to get "grafted" status. I can re-apply my modifications by applying
# a patch file generated by `git diff` of `my_mods` and `master` at the most recent
# commit of `my_mods`. Then, after `reset --hard` of `my_mods` to updated master
# (pulled from upstream) the patch can be re-applied, using
# `patch -p1 -i the.patch` from the root dir of vimtex.
